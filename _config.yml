  Hi, my name is Neil Gerring, I'm a Full Stack Software Developer with over 5 years experience, based in Oxfordshire.
  I am currently working as a Software Developer for Osirium on their task automation platform, PPA.

  I enjoy developing a range of software across the stack and taking a feature from design and planning stages to completion.

  with something new. The languages and frameworks I currently have the most experience working with are:
  <mark>Python</mark>,
  <mark>Golang</mark>,
  <mark>ReactJS</mark>,
  and <mark>Postgresql</mark>.

          <mark>Perl</mark> where the clientâ€™s requirements are not currently available or possible in the MessageFocus system. I also helped resolve

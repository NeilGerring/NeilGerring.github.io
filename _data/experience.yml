    I am currently working at Osirium as a Software Developer developing for Osirium PPA 
    which is a Task Automation platform. My main focus at the moment is developing and improving the 
    Task Builder feature which enables end users to build Docker based tasks using <mark>YAML</mark>. 
    The Task Builder feature incorporates a code editor which includes <mark>YAML</mark> validation into 
    the <mark>ReactJS</mark> frontend. The frontend utilises a WebSocket and a number of REST APIs to the 
    <mark>Golang</mark>  backend for building the docker image.

    Previously before developing for the PPA platform, I was developing <mark>Python</mark> packages
    that integrated with Third Party services such as Active Directory and Microsoft SQL Server. 
    These packages can then be used in the tasks developed for PPA. I also used these packages for 
    developing a number of internal tasks that our HR team can use. Such as a New Starter task, allowing 
    the HR team to easily set up a New Starter without the need for a Support ticket to be raised.
